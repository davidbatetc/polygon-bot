# Polygon bot
## Part 1: Class for convex polygons
The class should define, at least, the following operations:

- [x] Construct a convex polygon given by the coordinates of a set of points.
- [x] Check whether a point is inside another convex polygon.
- [ ] Check whether a convex polygon is inside another convex polygon.
- [x] Get the number of vertices and edges of a convex polygon.
- [x] Get the length of the perimeter of a convex polygon.
- [x] Get the area of a convex polygon.
- [x] Get the coordinates of the centroid of a convex polygon.
- [x] Check if a convex polygon is regular.
- [ ] Compute the intersection of two convex polygons.
- [x] Compute the convex union of two convex polygons.
- [x] Compute the bounding box of a convex polygon.
- [x] Draw convex polygons (with colors) in a PNG image.

## Part 2
### General
- [x] Comments: Two bars (//) introduce a comment up to the end of the line.
- [x] Identifiers are as usual: p, Q, p1, p2, pol_gr, ...
- [ ] Points in the commands are given by two pairs of real numbers, in standard notation, to denote the X and Y coordinates. For instance, 0 0 or 3.14 -5.5. When printed, all real numbers must be formatted with three digits after the decimal dot.
- [ ] Colors: Colors in the commands are given, between curly braces, by three real numbers in [0,1], in standard notation, to denote the RGB color. For instance, {0 0 0} denotes black, {1 0 0} denotes red, and {1 0.64 0} denotes orange.

### Commands
- [ ] The assigment command: The assignment command (:=) associates an variable with a convex polygon. If the polygon identifier is new, it will create it. If it already existed, it will overwrite the previous polygon. New polygons are black by default. It is an error to use a variable not yet defined.
- [ ] The print command prints a given polygon or a text. For polygons, the output must only contain the vertices in the convex hull of the polygon, in clockwise order, starting from the vertex will lower X (and the vertex with lower Y in case of ties).
- [ ] For texts, the text is given as a string of (simple) characters between quotes.
- [ ] The area command: The area command prints the area of the given polygon.
- [ ] The perimeter command: The perimeter command prints the perimeter of the given polygon.
- [ ] The vertices command: The vertices command prints the number of vertices of the convex hull of the given polygon.
- [ ] The centroid command: The centroid command prints the centroid of the given polygon.
- [ ] The color command: The color command associates a color to the given polygon variable.
- [ ] The inside command: Given two polygons, the inside command prints yes or no to tell whether the first is inside the second or not.
- [ ] The equal command: Given two polygons, the equal command prints yes or no to tell whether the two polygons are the same or not.
- [ ] The draw command: The draw command draws a list of polygons in a PNG file, each one with its associated color. The image should be of 400x400 pixels, with white background and the coordinates of the vertices should be scaled to fit in the 398x398 central part of the image, while preserving the original aspect ratio.

### Operators
- [ ] represents the intersection of two polygons.
- [ ] \+ represents the convex union of two polygons.
- [ ] \# is the unary operator that returns the bounding box of a polygon (it computes a new polygon with the four vertices cor responding to the bounding box of the given polygon).
- [ ] !n is an operator that (applied to a natural number n) returns a convex polygon made with n points drawn at random in the unit square ([0,1]Â²).
