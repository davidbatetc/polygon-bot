## Part 1: Class for convex polygons
The class should define, at least, the following operations:

- [x] ?Construct a convex polygon given by the coordinates of a set of points.
- [x] Check whether a point is inside another convex polygon.
- [ ] Check whether a convex polygon is inside another convex polygon.
- [x] Get the number of vertices and edges of a convex polygon.
- [x] Get the length of the perimeter of a convex polygon.
- [x] Get the area of a convex polygon.
- [x] Get the coordinates of the centroid of a convex polygon.
- [x] Check if a convex polygon is regular.
- [ ] Compute the intersection of two convex polygons.
- [ ] Compute the convex union of two convex polygons.
- [x] Compute the bounding box of a convex polygon.
- [x] Draw convex polygons (with colors) in a PNG image.


## Other To-dos
- [ ] Declare static methods as actually static.
- [ ] Fix regular polygon list order. Most western point should be the first in the points list.
